# Concurrent-UDP-File-Transfer
Enables a client to download “chunks” of a file from multiple servers (for example, ftp mirrors) distributed over the Internet, and assemble the chunks to form the complete file. When the server is the bottleneck, this can speed up the download of a large file over normal ftp.
